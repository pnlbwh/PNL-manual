# `pnlscripts`



# Disk usage logging

A report of the PNL's disk usage is generated by the software package
at https://github.com/pnlbwh/diskusage-logging.  It is installed on
the local network at

    /rfanfs/pnl-zorro/software/diskusage-logging

The scripts in here are called daily and weekly by a cron job that is defined
in

    /rfanfs/pnl-zorro/software/cron/daily.sh
    /rfanfs/pnl-zorro/software/cron/weekly.sh

To make sure the cron job is active, run

    crontab -ls

If it is active and running correctly, every week a report of the PNL's disk
usage will be generated and saved as
`/rfanfs/pnl-zorro/software/diskusage-logging/_data/report.html`. The cron job
is also configured to email the report to the head RA and Sylvain, although this
can be unreliable at times.

Make sure to check regularly that the report is being generated every week.

# Ad-hoc Software Installation


    git clone git://github.com/reckbo/pnlpipe && cd pnlpipe
    source activate pnlpipe

To get a list of available software packages, run

    ./pnlpipe install -h

    Usage:
        pnlpipe install [SWITCHES] softwareModule

    where softwareModule is one of:
    BRAINSTools
    FreeSurfer
    HCPPipelines
    Slicer
    UKFTractography
    mrtrix3
    nrrdchecker
    tract_querier
    trainingDataT1AHCC
    trainingDataT2Masks
    whitematteranalysis


To install one of them, running

    ./pnlpipe install <software>

For example,

    ./pnlpiipe install UKFTractography --version DiffusionPropagator

installs the `DiffusionPropagator` branch of `UKFTractography`.
The software is installed in `$PNLPIPE_SOFT`.

## UKFTractography Issues

Sometimes installing `UKFTractography` will give a build error, in this case
delete `$soft/UKFTractography-build` and try installing again.


# Conda: Software and Python Environments

It is recommended that each project have its own isolated software environment.
The advantages of this over a global environment are that it protects the
project from changes to the global environment, allows projects to use different
software configurations, and records what software was used to generate the
data.

To help with this, we are transitioning to using [pnlpipe](https://github.com/reckbo/pnlpipe)
to run our pipelines and install MRI processing software, and conda for setting up
our python environments.

Conda is a general purpose package manager whose advantage over virtualenv is
that it is not limited to python packages. This helps managing python packages
that have external dependencies such as NumPy, SciPy, VTK, and Matplotlib.
Conda is installed on the cluster as well as the local network.

To setup a conda environment, each project lists its dependencies in a file
called `environment.yml`.  Here's an example for a project that uses
`whitematteranalysis`:

    name: wma-664bb45
        dependencies:
          - nibabel
          - numpy
          - vtk
          - joblib
          - matplotlib
          - pip:
            - git+https://github.com/SlicerDMRI/whitematteranalysis.git@664bb45b34003689f0dccbed45cf864bb11ce4a5

To create and activate this environment, you would run

    conda env create -f  environment.yml
    source activate wma-664bb45

For running some of our standard pipelines, see [pnlpipe](https://github.com/reckbo/pnlpipe).

# Creating a Whitematteranalysis Environment

## Using Conda

In your project directory, make a file called something like `environment.yml`.
In this file put the following:

    name: wma-664bb45
    dependencies:
      - nibabel
      - numpy
      - vtk
      - joblib
      - matplotlib
      - pip:
         - git+https://github.com/SlicerDMRI/whitematteranalysis.git@664bb45b34003689f0dccbed45cf864bb11ce4a5

If `whitematteranalysis` has been updated recently and you want to use the most recent
version, visit https://github.com/SlicerDMRI/whitematteranalysis/commits/master and
copy the commit hash to the clipboard by clicking on the clipboard icon next to the
latest commit. Then delete the `664bb45...` part and paste the new commit.  Also
change the name to reflect this new commit.

Now run

    conda env create -f  environment.yml
    source activate wma-664bb45  # or wma-<chosen_commit>

and you should be able to run the whitematteranalysis scripts. If it
complains about a missing dependency, add it to `environment.yml` and
update the environment:

    conda env update -n <name> -f environment.yml

## Using pnlpipe

    git clone git://github.com/reckbo/pnlpipe && cd pnlpipe
    source activate pnlpipe
    ./pnlpipe install whitematteranalysis --version <github_commit>
    source $soft/whitematteranalysis-<github_commit>/env.sh
